How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows only the differences and its easy to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can access old version of the files easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros : We can choose when to commit a change 
    Cons : We need to do it manually	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    We can keep track of all the changes to all the files with single commit and it is easy to keep track of changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can get all the commits using git log
    We can get differences between the two commits with git diff	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Even though a bug is introduced by a commit, we can always go back to the previous commit using git hub.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For better version control
